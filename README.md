# ðŸ’– Dividitto

An app to register your home expenses ðŸ’° and divide based on family member income ðŸ’µ!

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

I was tired of using splitwise to divide my home expenses, so I decided to create my own app to do that. The main difference is that this app will divide based on family member income, so if you have a family member that earns more than you, he will pay more than you.

Also I wanted to experiment with [HTMX](htmx.org) + [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) + [WaterCSS](https://watercss.kognise.dev) as a really **fast** and **minimal** way of creating web apps. This way I reduce drastically the amount of code needed for the frontend maintaining a good UX without a **full page reload.**
